This firmware.bin was built on Marlin 2.0.7 for the BTT SKR V1.4 running TMC2209 drivers and a BTT TFT35 V3. This configuration assumes you are using 1.8deg steppers on all axis, 8mm pitch lead screws on Z with independant drivers for Z1 and Z2 (Firmware has G34 enabled for auto bed tramming),a Bondtech BMG for the extruder, and a BLtouch for the probe (I am using a V2020 triangle labs3D Touch, not a BLTouch). All microstepping has been set for 32 in the firmware, and current have been configured based on reliable operation on my printer. If you modify the marlin firmware and make changes you do so at your own risk. That being said. If you find configuration improvements please submit a pull request for me to review to integrate into the project.

Have Fun,
